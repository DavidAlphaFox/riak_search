* Riak Search Unit Tests

** Requirements

** Running the Sample Tests

   1. Insert the sample data into the datastore. You should only need to do
      this once:

      : ./bin/update.sh http://localhost:8098/solr/querytests sample_data/sample100.add

   2. Run the unit tests:

      : ./run_sample100.sh http://localhost:8098/solr/querytests
   
   3. Alternatively, run some queries:
      
      : ./bin/select.sh http://localhost:8098/solr/querytests "color:red"

** Adding New Tests

   At a high level, the run_sample100.sh test script runs queries
   against Riak Search, and compares the output against the same
   queries that were previously run against a Solr database containing
   the same set of documents.

   To add new tests, you will need to:

   1. Add a line for the test =./prepare_sample100.sh=

   2. Add a line for the test to =./run_sample100.sh=

   3. Set up an instance of Solr. This is easier than it sounds, just
      install and unzip solr, then:

      : cd ./apache-solr-1.4.0/example
      : java -jar start.jar

   4. Run the following command to initialize the Solr results:

      : ./prepare_sample100.sh http://localhost:8983/solr

** Other Directories

   - ./bin :: Holds utility scripts used to query against a Solr
	      interface, compare result sets, generate sample data, etc.

   - ./results :: Saved results from queries against a Solr
                  database. Used as baseline results for running tests
                  against Riak Search.

   - ./sample_data :: Sample data generated using
                      bin/generate_data.escript.
