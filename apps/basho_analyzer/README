This is a text analyzer component used by Riak Search. It leverages the tokenizing and analysis logic
in Lucene and exposes it to Erlang via a simple socket server which speaks Google's protocol buffers.

-- RUNNING --

Java:
  cd into riak_search/extras/analysis_server and execute 'ant'. cd into the rel/ directory and
  run the analysis_server.sh script to start the server. Edit the PORT variable if 127.0.0.1:6098
  isn't available.

Erlang:
  Build the code and start an Erlang VM. Make sure the sasl application is running. In the Erlang
  shell type 'application:start(basho_analyzer.)'. If all is well the application should start.
  Make sure the application environment entry, analysis_port, matches the PORT value used by the
  Java server.
